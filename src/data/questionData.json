At the critical angle, the refracted ray grazes the surface (90° to normal). Beyond this angle, Snell's law would require sin(θ₂) > 1, which is mathematically impossible since sine values cannot exceed 1. Therefore, no refraction can occur and all light is reflected. In the opposite direction, light bends toward the normal and can always be refracted.",

          "sampleAnswer": "Since refractive index varies with wavelength (dispersion), different colors have slightly different critical angles. Red light has a lower refractive index than blue light in most materials, so red has a larger critical angle than blue. When white light undergoes total internal reflection, colors near the critical angle may behave differently - some may be totally reflected while others are partially transmitted. This can cause chromatic effects at the critical angle transition. In practical applications like optical fibers, this wavelength dependence contributes to chromatic dispersion, which can limit bandwidth in multimode fibers.",

Procedure: Place semicircular block with flat edge facing light source. Gradually increase incident angle until no refracted ray appears on screen - this is the critical angle. Repeat measurements from different positions. Data analysis: Use n = 1/sin(θc) to calculate refractive index from average critical angle. Uncertainties: ±0.5° protractor precision, ±0.01 calculation error. Improvements: Use laser for precise beam, digital protractor for accuracy, temperature control since refractive index varies with temperature. Expected precision: ±0.02 in refractive index value.",

          "sampleAnswer": "A smart city fiber network requires hierarchical architecture with high-capacity backbone links connecting distributed edge computing nodes. Ring topology provides redundancy with automatic protection switching. 5G integration requires dense fiber infrastructure to small cells for low-latency applications. IoT sensor networks use fiber aggregation points with wireless last-mile connections. Autonomous vehicle systems need ultra-reliable low-latency connections through dedicated fiber channels. Emergency services require priority traffic handling and diverse routing paths. Security implementation includes encrypted optical transmission, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring. Scalability design uses modular add/drop multiplexers and software-defined networking for dynamic resource allocation. Future adaptation provisions include spare fiber capacity, upgradeable electronics, and standardized interfaces for emerging technologies. The architecture balances performance, cost, and flexibility while ensuring resilient operation under various failure scenarios.",

          "sampleAnswer": "Sustainable fiber network design requires lifecycle assessment from manufacturing through disposal. Energy efficiency improvements include using coherent optics to extend reach without regeneration, implementing sleep modes for unused equipment, and optimizing cooling systems in data centers. Carbon footprint reduction involves renewable energy for facilities, efficient routing algorithms to minimize active equipment, and local manufacturing to reduce transportation emissions. Electronic waste minimization uses modular designs for component upgrades, standardized interfaces for equipment reuse, and comprehensive recycling programs. Innovative solutions include solar-powered remote amplifiers, AI-driven network optimization for energy savings, biodegradable cable materials, and circular economy principles in equipment design. Network sharing among operators reduces infrastructure duplication, while software-defined networks enable dynamic resource allocation to minimize energy consumption during low-traffic periods.",
